# Data and inputs for the thermal exfoliation paper

This repository contains the input files and selected derived datasets supporting key results and conclusions in the manuscript:

**"[Paper title here]"** (to be updated upon publication).

It includes:
- MOOSE/Felino input files used to run the simulations reported in the paper
- Selected derived data (CSV) underlying key quantitative figures/comparisons
- Jupyter notebooks used to post-process results and generate manuscript figures

> Note: Full simulation output files (e.g., large Exodus `.e` files and large intermediate exports) are not included due to size/storage constraints. This archive provides the inputs and workflow needed to regenerate those outputs, and includes selected derived datasets sufficient to reproduce the **key quantitative figures** and conclusions reported in the manuscript.

## Software

Simulations were performed using:
- **Felino**: https://danielchou0916.github.io/felino.github.io/  
- **MOOSE Framework**: https://mooseframework.inl.gov/

Please cite the archived DOI of this repository (see “Citation” below) when referencing these materials.

## Repository structure

- `inputs/`  
  MOOSE/Felino input files (`.i`) used to generate the simulations in the paper.

- `CSV/`  
  Selected derived datasets in CSV format used for key quantitative plotting and comparisons.

- `Python_notebooks/`  
  Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) used for plotting and post-processing.

## Figure-to-data mapping (CSV-based figures)

The table below indicates which manuscript items can be reproduced **directly from the archived CSV datasets**.

| Manuscript item | Input file(s) | CSV file(s) | Notebook |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fig. 10   | `inputs/...` | `CSV/No*.csv` | `Python_notebooks/2_load_csv.ipynb` |
| Fig. 8(b) | `inputs/...` | `CSV/col*.csv` | `Python_notebooks/2_load_csv.ipynb` |

Other figures in the manuscript are **field-variable visualizations** (e.g., contour plots) that are generated from full simulation outputs. These full outputs are not archived due to size, but can be regenerated using the workflow described below. The relevant notebook file is `Python_notebooks/0_read_outputs_BC_and_ICs.ipynb`.

## How to reproduce results

### A) Reproduce the CSV-based figures (Fig. 10 and Fig. 8(b))
1. Create a Python environment with Jupyter and common scientific packages (e.g., numpy, pandas, matplotlib).
2. Open `Python_notebooks/2_load_csv.ipynb` and run all cells.
3. If needed, adjust the CSV directory path in the first cell (recommended to run notebooks from the repository root).
4. The notebook will load data from `CSV/` and regenerate the figures.

### B) Regenerate field-variable plots (contour figures)
1. Run the `.i` files in `inputs/` with Felino/MOOSE to generate simulation outputs (e.g., Exodus `.e` files).
2. Use the notebooks and/or standard visualization tools (e.g., ParaView) to reproduce the field-variable plots from the generated outputs.

## Notes

Large intermediate simulation outputs (e.g., full-field/time-history outputs and very large exports) are not archived due to storage constraints. They can be regenerated by running the provided inputs with Felino/MOOSE and executing the post-processing workflow.
